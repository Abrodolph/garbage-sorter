## ‚ôªÔ∏è AI-Powered Garbage Sorter

A web application that uses a deep learning model to classify garbage into different categories. This tool helps users correctly sort their waste by simply uploading an image.

## ‚ú® Key Features

Image-Based Classification: Upload an image of any waste item to get an instant classification.

Multiple Categories: The model is trained to recognize a wide range of garbage types, including glass, paper, cardboard, plastic, metal, and more.

Simple Web Interface: A clean and intuitive user interface built with Flask makes it easy for anyone to use.

Deep Learning Model: Powered by a robust Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
The application workflow is straightforward:

Image Upload: The user selects an image of a garbage item and uploads it through the web interface.

Image Preprocessing: The backend receives the image and preprocesses it to match the input requirements of the machine learning model (e.g., resizing to the correct dimensions).

Model Prediction: The preprocessed image is passed to the pre-trained Keras model (final_model.h5). The model analyzes the image and predicts the probability for each garbage category.

Display Results: The category with the highest probability is identified, and the result is sent back to the user and displayed on the prediction page.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

Backend: Python, Flask

Machine Learning: TensorFlow, Keras, Pillow

Frontend: HTML, CSS (from templates/ and static/ directories)

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset

The model was trained on the "Garbage Classification" dataset, which contains images sorted into the following categories:

Battery

Biological

Brown Glass

Cardboard

Clothes

Green Glass

Metal

Paper

Plastic

Shoes

Trash

White Glass

The dataset is located in the garbage_classification/ directory of this repository.
